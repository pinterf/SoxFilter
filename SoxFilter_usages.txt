Effect #26
gain
[-e|-b|-B|-r] [-n] [-l|-h] [gain-dB]
-e	 Equalise channels: peak to that with max peak;
-B	 Balance channels: rms to that with max rms; no clip protection
-b	 Balance channels: rms to that with max rms; clip protection
	   Note -Bn = -bn
-r	 Reclaim headroom (as much as possible without clipping); see -h
-n	 Norm file to 0dBfs(output precision); gain-dB, if present, usually <0
-l	 Use simple limiter
-h	 Apply attenuation for headroom for subsequent effects; gain-dB, if
	   present, is subject to reclaim by a subsequent gain -r
gain-dB	 Apply gain in dB
